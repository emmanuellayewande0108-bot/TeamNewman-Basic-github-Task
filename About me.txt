Hello! I’m Emmanuella, a graduate and aspiring Software Tester (QA) with a strong interest in software quality and user experience.
I’m currently building my foundation in:
Manual Software Testing
Test case and test scenario creation
Bug identification and reporting
Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration
This repository is part of my learning journey, where I practice, document my progress, and improve my testing skills through hands-on work.
